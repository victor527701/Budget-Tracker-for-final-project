# Overview of my project
I made a budget/money tracker that finances your money. It starts off by giving you 5 options:

Option 1 is adding transactions. When you add a transaction, it asks the purpose of the transaction, how much is being transacted, and weather it is for income or spending. Then, it saves that information. You can then view the transaction when you press 2, and should look like this.

Option 3 gives you the choice to save the information to a file named budget.txt. When you do this, all the information of your banking/tansactions will be saved to budget.txt. Option 4 loads the information from the file. Option 5 simply exits the program. All of this is ran through the console.
